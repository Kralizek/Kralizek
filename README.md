# Hi üñê
My name is Renato and I was born in Naples, Italy but I've been living in Stockholm, Sweden since 2008.

I have been working with .NET since its first versions and I have been working with AWS tools since 2010.

Currently, I'm the CTO of [Educations Media Group (EMG)](https://educationsmediagroup.com).
When I'm not busy with powerpoints and spreadsheets, I like to help my team with utility libraries, templates, and whatever can make their work more efficient.

In my spare time, I like board- and videogames, photography, and fantasy and sci-fi books on all media.
I also enjoy contributing to the .NET community. Over the years I have started my own projects and contributed to others'.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renatogolia/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Kralizek).

My resume is available [here](https://github.com/Kralizek/Kralizek/blob/master/files/cv/Curriculum%20-%202020-09-01.pdf).

## Open source projects I work with

Started by me:
- [Nybus](https://github.com/Nybus-project/) is an application framework that allows you to build message-based applications in .NET Core and .NET Framework.
It offers an abstraction layer over the actual messaging technology allowing the support of multiple engines.
- [AWS Lambda C# templates](https://github.com/Kralizek/AWSLambdaSharpTemplate) are a series of templates that help developers creating AWS Lambda functions using C# without giving up on SOLID principles.
- [.NET Configuration Extensions for AWS SecretsManager](https://github.com/Kralizek/AWSSecretsManagerConfigurationExtensions) is a provider for Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration that retrieves secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager.

I contribute to:
- [AutoFixture](https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture/) makes it easier for developers to do Test-Driven Development by automating non-relevant Test Fixture Setup, allowing the Test Developer to focus on the essentials of each test case.
