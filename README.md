# Hi üñê
My name is Renato and I was born in Naples, Italy but I've been living in Stockholm, Sweden since 2008.

I have been working with .NET since its first versions and I have been working with AWS tools since 2010.

Currently I am working at my own company, [Insight Architectures](https://www.insightarchitectures.com).

I founded Insight Architectures to provide other companies consulting and freelancing services based on the things I learned in my 12 years at [Educations Media Group](https://educationsmediagroup.com), where I worked as Software Architect and CTO.

In my spare time, I like board- and videogames, photography, and fantasy and sci-fi books on all media.

I also enjoy contributing to the .NET community. Over the years I have started my own projects and contributed to others'. My projects are mostly tools for other developers to make their work more efficient.

You can find more about me on my personal web site: [https://renatogolia.com](https://renatogolia.com).

## Open source projects I work with

Started by me:
- [Nybus](https://github.com/Nybus-project/) is an application framework that allows you to build message-based applications in .NET Core and .NET Framework.
It offers an abstraction layer over the actual messaging technology allowing the support of multiple engines.
- [AWS Lambda C# templates](https://github.com/Kralizek/AWSLambdaSharpTemplate) are a series of templates that help developers creating AWS Lambda functions using C# without giving up on SOLID principles.
- [.NET Configuration Extensions for AWS SecretsManager](https://github.com/Kralizek/AWSSecretsManagerConfigurationExtensions) is a provider for Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration that retrieves secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager.

I contribute to:
- [AutoFixture](https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture/) makes it easier for developers to do Test-Driven Development by automating non-relevant Test Fixture Setup, allowing the Test Developer to focus on the essentials of each test case.
