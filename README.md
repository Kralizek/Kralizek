# Hi 🖐

My name is Renato and I was born in Naples, Italy, but I’ve been living in Stockholm, Sweden since 2008.

I’ve been working with .NET since its early days and with AWS since around 2010. Since 2023, I’ve also been working actively with Azure, mainly in large-scale cloud and platform-oriented systems. My focus is mostly on backend, cloud architecture, and distributed systems.

I currently work as a **Software Architect** in the **Cloud Services Team at [Tobii Dynavox](https://www.tobiidynavox.com/)**, where I help design and evolve large-scale cloud platforms.

Alongside my full-time role, [**Insight Architectures**](https://www.insightarchitectures.com/) is still active and provides sporadic consulting services based on my experience as a Software Architect and CTO. I’m also one of the founders of [**EduConvert**](https://www.educonvert.com), and I’m currently working on [**Xilo**](https://xilo.work), a product focused on helping individuals and teams better understand how they spend their time.

In my spare time, I enjoy board and video games, photography, and fantasy and sci-fi books across all media.

I occasionally write technical articles on my personal website, mostly about software development, architecture, and cloud-related topics:
